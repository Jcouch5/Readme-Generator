# Readme Generator
## Description
In this project I built on the starter code to create a ReadMe generator. I added prompts from the inquirer package and used the FS package to create a file from the responses to the prompts.

I used switch statements to match the license selected to its badge and link. I used template literals in order to create a template for the readme to be created from.
